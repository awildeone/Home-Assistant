# The *goal*

I want complete feature parity between Home Assistiant and Control4. For me, I want video matrix control and audio matrix control and control. There are some devices that are meant for AV integration that Home Assistant doesn't support out of the box. So I'm working on that and making documentation that others can follow.

*Note:* An AV receiver is NOT a matrix. Some features may overlap, but they are NOT the same.
